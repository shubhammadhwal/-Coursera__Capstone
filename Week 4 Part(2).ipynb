The geographical location- coordinates for each neighborhood can be obtained by using the geopy client.\n### 3. I'll also need the population for each neighborhood.\n### 4. Foursquare API is used to get nearest venue locations. By writing appropriate URI desired data can be obtained. The call returns a JSON file and we need to turn that into a data frame. ",
